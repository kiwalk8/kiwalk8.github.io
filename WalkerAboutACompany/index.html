        Welcome to Tucker's Cat Café! Located in south Springfield, we are happy to provide the <em>purrrfect</em> cup
        of coffee with even better company.
    </h2>
    <p id="AboutPara">Founded in 2023, Tucker's Cat Café is the first of its kind in Springfield, MO. Owned by fur
        siblings Cassie,
        Hallie, and Tucker, we provide a place to love on cats while sipping on your favorite cup of coffee.
        Tucker's Cat Café partners with Hallie's Haven, a cat rescue organization, to provide safe shelter for foster
        cats. Check out our experiences page to learn more about our coffee and our furry residents.
